# Common Data Model for Nonprofits

The Common Data Model for Nonprofits (CDM) is an open source data schema that provides a common foundation for nonprofit solutions. It is made up of entities and attributes commonly used by nonprofits across fundraising, constituent management, awards, program delivery, and impact tracking. It reflects industry best practices and promotes cross-solution and cross-organization data integration, enabling powerful insights across activities and departments.

The CDM provides a foundation for vendors, partners, and nonprofits to map their applications and connectors for data and application interoperability.
