# Fundraising

Fundraising is an extensible, model-driven template app built on the Microsoft Power Platform. It is designed to help nonprofits modernize their fundraising efforts and prepare for future innovation with a foundation that is focused on data and AI. By using this app, partners can help customers create a complete picture of individual and organizational constituentsâ€™ demographics, contact methods, relationships, and communication preferences.

Fundraising aggregates constituent and fundraising data across various constituent types and channels. It creates comprehensive constituent and organizational profiles, enabling fundraisers to gain insights necessary for proactive engagement and stewardship throughout the giving lifecycle. Fundraising enables users to:

- Create a complete picture of individual and organizational constituents by type, demographics, contact methods, relationships, and communication preferences.
- Manage gifts by channel and type, including pledges, payment schedules, and transactions.
- View a comprehensive donation history for individual and organizational donors.
- Process gifts, import donations, and generate receipt data.

Fundraising is built on the [Common Data Model (CDM) for Nonprofits](https://aka.ms/GitHubCDMforNonprofits), an industry-led, open-source data schema that reflects industry best practices and connects data across the organization to enable powerful interoperability, fuel greater insight and efficacy, and provide data transparency. With the CDM and Power Platform as the foundation, Fundraising connects with other platforms and applications in a seamless data flow, increasing operational efficiency and enabling data-driven decision-making.
