# Volunteer Management

Volunteer Management is an app, built on the Microsoft Power Platform, that streamlines volunteer coordination efforts. It enables volunteer managers to more efficiently manage day-to-day processes to recruit, onboard, and retain volunteers.

Using Volunteer Management, volunteer managers and coordinators can move away from spreadsheets, documents, and systems built for donors and program participants to a solution built specifically to meet their needs. With Volunteer Management, engagement opportunities are located in a central place, capturing dates, locations, volunteer numbers, skills, and training. Using this information, volunteer managers can match volunteers with the right opportunities. Volunteer Management also facilitates a consistent onboarding process that enables better management and tracking of the volunteer experience.

Volunteer Management enables users to:

- Design engagement opportunities and define the qualifications, skills, and shifts needed.
- Review volunteer profiles and qualifications, and then approve individuals to participate in engagement opportunities.
- Track volunteer onboarding, quickly and easily understanding what stage of the onboarding process the volunteer is in.
- Manage day-of activities including tracking attendance and balancing shift volumes when an activity is happening.
- Communicate with volunteers using automated messaging to ensure volunteers receive timely logistics, training, and gratitude for their time.
- Gain volunteer insights, understanding who is registering for, failing to show up to, and repeatedly contributing time to the organization.
