# üöÄ Azure Landing Zone for Nonprofits Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to deploying the **Azure Landing Zone for Nonprofits**, ensuring a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure aligned with best practices.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

Before initiating the deployment, ensure you have the following:

- **Dedicated Azure subscriptions**: Two dedicated subscriptions are required to separate platform components for better management and security.
- **A global admin in Microsoft Entra ID**: You must have the **Global Administrator** role in **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory).
- **Elevated Access**: Ensure you have **Owner** permissions at the **Elevation of privileges:**
  - Elevate the global admin privileges to grant the **User Access Administrator** role at the tenant root scope (/).
  - Perform an explicit role assignment (Azure RBAC) at the tenant root scope using Azure CLI or PowerShell.

## üõ† Elevate access for deployment

To manage resources across the tenant, temporarily elevate your access as a global admin. After deployment, remove the elevated access.

Sign into the Azure portal as the global admin.

Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID > Properties**.

Under Access management for Azure resources, set the toggle to Yes.

## üõ† Grant explicit access at tenant root scope
Use either Azure CLI or PowerShell to assign the necessary permissions to the user performing the deployment.

You don't have to be a global admin to deploy Azure Landing Zones. This role assignment can be made to a different user or group.


Using **Bash (Azure CLI)**:
```sh

# Sign into AZ CLI, this will redirect you to a web browser for authentication if required 
az login 
 
# Assign Owner role to Tenant root scope ("/") as Owner (fetches object Id of the current user) 
az role assignment create --scope '/' --role 'Owner' --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query "objectId" --output tsv)

```

Using **PowerShell**:

```sh

# Sign in to Azure from PowerShell, this redirects you to a web browser for authentication if required
Connect-AzAccount 
 
# Get object Id of the current user for the role assignment 
$user = Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName (Get-AzContext).Account 
 
# Assign Owner role to Tenant root scope ("/") as a User Access Administrator 
New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope '/' -RoleDefinitionName 'Owner' -ObjectId $user.Id

   ```

It can take up to 15 minutes for permissions to propagate at the tenant root scope. Sign out and sign back in to refresh the token before proceeding with the deployment.

## ‚úÖ **Deploy the Azure Landing Zone Template**
With the necessary permissions in place, proceed to deploy the landing zone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Prepare inputs**

Gather all required input values before starting the deployment. These values are used throughout the process and are listed in the following table.

You must provide details including:

- Azure subscription and deployment region
- Network configuration (for example, Virtual Network name and subnet details)
- Security settings (for example, Key Vault name, Recovery Services Vault name)
- Management group structure
- Some values, such as Key Vault names, must be globally unique and might need modification.
