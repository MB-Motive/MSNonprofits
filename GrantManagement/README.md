# Grant Management

Grant Management is an extensible, model-driven template app built on the Microsoft Power Platform. It is designed to help nonprofits modernize their grant management efforts and prepare for future innovation with a foundation that is focused on data and AI. By using this app, partners can help customers consolidate constituent and grant data into a comprehensive profile that helps both grant seekers and grant makers manage the entire grant lifecycle.

Grant Management aggregates constituent and grant data into a comprehensive profile that provides insights to proactively manage the end-to-end grant management lifecycle, from request to award, reporting, stakeholder engagement, and disbursement receipt. Grant Management enables users to:

- Create a complete picture of individual and organizational constituents by type, demographics, contact methods, relationships, and communication preferences.
- Manage grant requests and awarded grants, including types, amounts, recipient details, reporting schedules, and timelines.
- Track disbursements by type, amount, status, and schedule.
- Aggregate reports and manage activities, providing insights into, and enabling proactive management of, stakeholders across the grant lifecycle.

Grant Management is built on the [Common Data Model (CDM) for Nonprofits](https://aka.ms/GitHubCDMforNonprofits), an industry-led, open-source data schema that reflects industry best practices and connects data across the organization to enable powerful interoperability, fuel greater insight and efficacy, and provide data transparency. With the CDM and Power Platform as the foundation, Grant Management connects with other platforms and applications in a seamless data flow, increasing operational efficiency and enabling data-driven decision-making.
