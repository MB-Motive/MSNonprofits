# Volunteer Engagement

Volunteer Engagement is a Power Page that enables volunteers to easily find and apply for engagement opportunities. It helps volunteers support your organization’s mission by providing a one-stop shop for volunteers to view engagement details, complete training and onboarding, and find future opportunities. Built on the Power Platform, Volunteer Engagement interfaces with Volunteer Management and external-facing websites.

Volunteer Engagement enables users to:

- Search and sign up for volunteer opportunities that match interest, skills, schedule, and location.
- Create and update their volunteer profile, including contact information, availability, preferences, and qualifications.
- See the status of upcoming opportunities, past engagements, and the number of hours they’ve volunteered.
